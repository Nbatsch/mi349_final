        <h3>Hello There!</h3>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I have an incredibly wide variety of hobbies ranging from golfing
            to building computers. Once I find something I'm interested in,
            I pour my heart into learning more about it; achieving a degree
            of proficiency in it, and sharing my love for that hobby with others.

        </p>

        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        <p>I’m passionate about exploring different cultures and learning
            about traditions that are different from my own. I believe food
            tells a lot about the land, identity, and struggles that people had to
            endure throughout history. Being someone with an immense
            appreciation for good food, I decided to learn how to cook to pay homage to the cultures that
            created such wonderful dishes, with the added bonus of being able to enjoy and share them
            with friends. I was fortunate to attend classes at the Culinary Institute of
            America at Copia to advance in my journey to create food that makes people happy.
        </p>

        <h4 id="golf">Golf</h4>
        <p> Golf is the game that taught me patience, perseverance, and integrity. As a child I
            participated in and won several junior tournaments, but it wasn’t until high school when I
            really started loving the game; studying and practicing every day to sharpen my skills,
            understanding the physics behind the golf swing, and improving my strategy and “course
            management.” By junior year I became captain of the varsity team at Notre Dame Prep,
            leading my team to victory at regionals and scoring lowest for
            our team at states. I was on track to play college golf, but
            unfortunately herniated a disc at a Callaway tournament which
            ended my competitive golf career. After a great deal of physical
            therapy and acupuncture, I’m very blessed to be able to play the game that I love.
